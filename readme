Case Study

Read and understand the use case, assume any missing data/information, if necessary, build a 
python application. Zip and share the files with us once done within specified time. Please download 
the mentioned dataset from Kaggle before starting with this exercise. Read and understand the ‘file’
and ‘column’ descriptions provided on Kaggle. 
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/berkayalan/retail-sales-data
If you do not have a python runtime locally installed, you can choose to use Google Colaboratory
Notebooks (https://colab.research.google.com/) or something similar. 
We do not expect you to spend more than 4 – 6 hours to solve this use case.

Requirements
1. Build a python application which can read from provided datasets and based on the user’s 
input, aggregate the data accordingly and return the value back to the user. It would be 
good if you can create a REST API interface for your python application.
User can possibly ask for:
• Total Sales quantity and revenue for Specific product hierarchy1_id and specified date range ->

ApiName:http://127.0.0.1:5000/getproduct_hierarchywise

parameters: {"hierarchy1_id":"H00","start_date":"2017-01-03","end_date":"2017-01-03"}

• Total Sales quantity and revenue for Specific city id and specified date range ->

ApiName:http://127.0.0.1:5000/getcity_storetypedata
parameters: {"city_id":"C013","start_date":"2017-01-03","end_date":"2017-01-03"}

• Total volume (using provided product dimensions multiplied by quantity) of a specific product for specified data range.
->
ApiName:http://127.0.0.1:5000/getsale_productdata
parameters: {"product_id":"P0001","start_date":"2017-01-03","end_date":"2017-01-03"}


Bonus Question:
• Assuming the Region to be Sweden, calculate Total revenue on 2018 Public holiday 
dates. You can choose to either web scrape or download public holidays for 2018.->
refernce 
https://pypi.org/project/holidays/


Example Input to the application:
    {“hierarchy1_id” : “H03” , “start_date” : “2017-09-01” , “end_date” : “2017-09-10” }
    Example Output :
    {“Quantity” : “200” , “Revenue” : “4500” }

You can choose to use JSON or any other format you prefer.

Optional Step:
Containerize this application, the application should be executable with a docker run 
command. Zip it, and share your code with us, including app.py, requirements, docker file 
and any other files you created.
-> i don't have much experience of docker so i cannot create the docker images

2. If there is a requirement to deploy the above application on GCP, which services will you 
prefer to use and why ? ->
I am preferring the App Engine for this application for deployment purposes. 
because these application need less infrastructure so i go with App Engine platform
